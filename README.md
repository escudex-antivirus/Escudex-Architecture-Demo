# Escudex | AI-Native Software Architecture & Android Security Suite

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A high-performance Android security ecosystem where 100% of the production-grade code was orchestrated by an AI-Native Architect.** This project serves as a benchmark for **SDLC 2.0**: demonstrating how expert LLM orchestration can deliver complex, secure, and premium-tier software at a much faster speed without compromising architectural integrity.

## 🤖 The AI-Native Orchestration Advantage

This isn't just "AI-generated code"—it's **Architect-Led AI Orchestration**. I managed a complete, interlinked ecosystem through a multi-agent workflow:

* **Strategic Prompt Chaining:** Orchestrated distinct AI agents to build modular components that adhere to strict **SOLID** and **Clean Architecture** patterns.
* **Complex Dependency Resolution:** Directed the AI through iterative loops to resolve high-complexity integration issues, specifically managing the transition to **Kotlin 2.0** and **SDK 36** while aligning conflicting versions of **AWS Amplify (Smithy)**, **Firebase**, and **Google Play Billing**.
* **Security-First Audit Loop:** As the Architect, I performed 100% of the code verification, ensuring compliance with Android’s most sensitive APIs (`DevicePolicyManager`, `UsageStats`, `LocationServices`).

## 🎨 Premium UX & Performance Engineering

In security, trust is built through the interface. Escudex combines aesthetic excellence with high-efficiency code:

* **State-Driven UI Transitions:** A reactive UI that responds instantly to background events, representando uma experiência de usuário "sempre protegida".
* **Modern Material 3:** Adherence to the latest design systems with custom assets optimized for clarity and native feel.
* **Resource-Aware UX:** UI logic is strictly decoupled from heavy processing, ensuring 60fps interaction even during deep system scans.

## 🏗 Architectural Integrity

The app is built for scale, performance, and cross-platform communication:

| Layer | Technology | AI-Native Enforcement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | **Clean / MVVM** | Strict separation of Data, Domain, and UI layers. |
| **Remote Control** | **Firebase (FCM)** | Real-time command bridge (Alarm, GPS, Lock) via Web Panel. |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | **AWS Amplify / Cognito** | Secure identity management and robust cloud synchronization. |
| **Hardware Orchestration** | **WakeLocks / GPS** | Expert management of battery-intensive resources for Anti-Theft. |
| **Modern Build System** | **Gradle / Kotlin 2.0** | Advanced dependency resolution and SDK 36 optimization. |

## 🔍 Featured Code Slices (Architectural Case Studies)

The `/samples` directory highlights how I solved complex hurdles through expert AI supervision:

### 1. Cross-Stack Dependency Orchestration (`build.gradle.kts`)
* **The Problem:** Integrating conflicting library ecosystems (Amplify, Firebase, Billing) while migrating to Kotlin 2.0.0 and SDK 36.
* **The Orchestration:** Guided the AI through a complex **Dependency Resolution Strategy**, resolving `aws.smithy.kotlin` versioning conflicts and implementing the modern Compose Compiler plugin for a future-proof build.

### 2. Remote Command Bridge via Firebase (`PushNotificationService.kt`)
* **The Problem:** Enabling instant execution of Anti-Theft features (GPS Tracking, Alarm, Screen Lock) with zero latency on Android 14+.
* **The Orchestration:** Orchestrated a secure bridge using **FCM High-Priority** messages. The service identifies remote commands and immediately triggers specialized Foreground Services or the `RemoteLockActivity`, bypassando restrições de background do sistema.

### 3. Anti-Theft Hardware Management (`AntiTheftLocationService.kt`)
* **The Problem:** Ensuring accurate location tracking remains active during "Doze Mode" or when the device is locked.
* **The Orchestration:** Orchestrated a service using `PowerManager.WakeLock` and `FusedLocationProvider`, ensuring the security protocol finishes its data transmission before releasing hardware resources.

### 4. High-Performance File I/O (`FileScanner.kt`)
* **The Problem:** Hashing large volumes of data (SHA-256) without memory overflows or UI freezing.
* **The Orchestration:** Directed the implementation of a **Buffered Byte-Stream** approach, navigating Android's Scoped Storage safely via `ContentResolver` for maximum performance and security compliance.

### 5. Reactive State Architecture (`SharedViewModel.kt`)
* **The Problem:** Maintaining a consistent security state across the entire app while reacting to asynchronous cloud and billing events.
* **The Orchestration:** Implemented a central state machine using `StateFlow` and `Channels` (Single Source of Truth), ensuring the UI perfectly reflects protection status and real-time remote commands.
